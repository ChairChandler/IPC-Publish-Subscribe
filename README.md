# **IPC Publish Subscribe** ![Build_status](https://travis-ci.org/ChairChandler/IPC-Publish-Subscribe.svg?branch=master)


[Publishâ€“subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are.

[Interprocess communication (IPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication) refers specifically to the mechanisms an operating system provides to allow the processes to manage shared data. Typically, applications can use IPC, categorized as clients and servers, where the client requests data and the server responds to client requests.
